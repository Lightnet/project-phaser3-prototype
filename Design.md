# Design:
 Phaser 3.3.0 has some good features (Haven't looking into deep how it works) that depend on the where to look in the documents or video online. Lance-gg would help mutiplayer build for easy to used client and server frame work engine design.

 Phaser JS has scene manager to able to change the scenes. As for client and server lance-gg will handle spawn and destorying object when event are update from server side using physics.

 Note this is just one instance room and doesn't have more rooms or channels build yet.
